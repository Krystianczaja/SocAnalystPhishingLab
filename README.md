#  SOC Analyst Simulator  â€“ Firewall and Phishing ticket


---

## Description
This lab simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow using **two representative tickets**.  
- **Ticket 1:** A firewall alert, where users investigate blocked external connections, confirm potential threats, and record the incident response.  
- **Ticket 2:** A phishing alert, where users practice analyzing suspicious emails and URLs, verifying threats, and documenting their findings.  


The lab emphasizes practical SOC skills, threat analysis, and proper incident documentation for real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

## Tools and Utilities Used

- **Splunk**  
- **Analyst VM / SOC Environment**  
- **Email Analysis Tools**  
- **Python / Bash (optional scripting for analysis)**  

---

## Environment Used

- **Windows 10 / Linux (VMs)**  
- **TryHackMe SOC Lab Environment**

## Lab Walk-through
1. All incoming alerts are triaged in the SOC alert queue. Alerts are prioritized based on severity, potential impact, and likelihood of being malicious

2. I start with the highest severity alert because it represents the greatest potential risk to the organization. This ensures critical threats are addressed immediately.

3. Action Taken: Opened the SIEM (Splunk) and looked up the URL associated with the alert.

Purpose: To verify if the URL was flagged in the threat intelligence feeds and confirm the firewall correctly blocked it.

Outcome: Verified that the URL matched a known malicious or blacklisted domain and that the threat was successfully blocked.
