2. I start with the highest severity alert because it represents the greatest potential risk to the organization. This ensures critical threats are addressed immediately.

3. Action Taken: Opened the SIEM (Splunk/Chronicle) and looked up the URL associated with the alert.

Purpose: To verify if the URL was flagged in the threat intelligence feeds and confirm the firewall correctly blocked it.

Outcome: Verified that the URL matched a known malicious or blacklisted domain and that the threat was successfully blocked.
